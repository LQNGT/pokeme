After doing our discovery interviews, we found that UC Davis students had some key problems that we could group into 4 different themes.

The first theme we discovered was difficulty finding people to play with. We talked to a badminton player, a volleyball player, and a soccer player who all expressed that outside of organized clubs or existing friend groups it was hard to find people to play sports with.

The second problem we discovered was social awkwardness with joining and talking to strangers. The basketball player transfer student we talked to said it was awkward to approach random people at the ARC and ask if he could join their groups because most of the groups were already established.

The third problem we discovered was scheduling conflicts. This problem was consistent across both sports and non-sports activities. People would be busy with HW or job hunting. For group assignments, it was often hard to find meeting times that worked for everyone. For the gym, it was hard for our interviewees to find the right time to go with their friends to the gym.

The final theme we discovered was that there was a commitment mismatch when trying to join activities. An example of this is that students wouldn't want to join intramurals because they took too long, and often they would want something spontaneous without dealing with the advance scheduling inconvenience.

Some early ways our app could solve these people include: group matching, same-day matches, skill level filters, repeat game scheduling, and social integrations such as including a user's number or instagram so people can stay in touch.

Our thinking has changed as we realized that people are more willing to do something if it is in a group rather than 1 on 1, we need to take into account peoples' skill levels, and that we need both spontaenous activities for people to do and repeat activities for the people who want to stay committed.
