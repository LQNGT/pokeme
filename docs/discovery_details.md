1st interview: 
I talked to a member of the badminton club 
I asked him if he ever played badminton outside of the club and he said no
When I asked why he said it's because he doesn't have anyone to play with
i then asked him what's hard about finding people to play with outside of the club and he said that most people that play at the ARC already have their own group so it's hard to just go and join a court
I then asked him about a solution that could solve this issue but he couldn't think of anything
I pitched our app idea to him and he said that it would definitely solve his issue however he mentionned an issue with the app. Basically once people find their sports buddy/group on the app they would stop using it.

2nd interview:
I talked to a student who plays volleyball
She told me that she only plays back home with her friends because she does not have a friend group here in Davis thhat can play volleyball
She explained to me that Volleyball is one of those sports where you can just go to a court and join the game
I asked her why she doesn't just do that and she said because sometimes the teams are full and she feels nervous joining random people's games
I asked her what would solve her issue and she said the intramural programs at the ARC sounds interesting
The issue with intramural is that it's a quarter long tournamnet so it's a lot of commitment
I then told her about our app idea and she pointed out that we should implement a way to join groups of people rather then just one to one matchings.

1st interview:
I talked to a student who likes attending random social events.
He said it is difficult to get into playing sports, because their friends often have schedule conflicts and sometimes do not want to commit to an activity.
They say because of this, they oftentimes just opt not to play, and do other activities with more people instead of pursuing what they may have wanted to explore.
A solution they try to do to resolve this is try to schedule dates far in advance to play, but they say this is inconvenient because he wants to play sooner rather than later.
After speaking about our app idea, they thought it was a decent solution, but he would feel uncomfortable playing with strangers.
He suggested emphasizing user profiles to make it easier to play with new people and potentially make new friends.

2nd interview:
I talked to a student who likes to play soccer and other sports.
He said while he normally doesn't have an issue finding friends to play sports with, that on some days when friends are out due to holidays or in general, that he feels very bored and wishes that he could join quick matches.
I asked what were some solutions he had for this matter. He said that he joins social media platforms (i.e. Discord, Insta groups, etc) and clubs, and tries to arrange games that way.
They told me this solution was not consistently effective.
After introducing our app idea, he said it would be something he would be willing to try, but he voiced concerns about the amount of people on the app. They suggested maybe trying some way to make an integration with another social media app.
