1st interview: 
I talked to a member of the badminton club 
I asked him if he ever played badminton outside of the club and he said no
When I asked why he said it's because he doesn't have anyone to play with
i then asked him what's hard about finding people to play with outside of the club and he said that most people that play at the ARC already have their own group so it's hard to just go and join a court
I then asked him about a solution that could solve this issue but he couldn't think of anything
I pitched our app idea to him and he said that it would definitely solve his issue however he mentionned an issue with the app. Basically once people find their sports buddy/group on the app they would stop using it.

2nd interview:
I talked to a student who plays volleyball
She told me that she only plays back home with her friends because she does not have a friend group here in Davis thhat can play volleyball
She explained to me that Volleyball is one of those sports where you can just go to a court and join the game
I asked her why she doesn't just do that and she said because sometimes the teams are full and she feels nervous joining random people's games
I asked her what would solve her issue and she said the intramural programs at the ARC sounds interesting
The issue with intramural is that it's a quarter long tournamnet so it's a lot of commitment
I then told her about our app idea and she pointed out that we should implement a way to join groups of people rather then just one to one matchings.

1st interview:
I talked to a transfer student who told me it has been hard to make friends since moving to Davis
He said he wants to play basketball more often but usually has no one consistent to text and meet at the ARC
I asked what makes it hard and he said people already come in groups and he feels awkward asking to join
He said he tried group chats before but most plans die out because no one confirms a time
I pitched our app idea and he said matching by sport and availability would help him a lot, especially if it can create repeat games with the same people

2nd interview:
I talked to a student who works part time and has an inconsistent class schedule
She said she likes volleyball and pickleball but cannot commit to intramurals because her free times change every week
When I asked what she needs she said she wants quick same-day or next-day match options with people near her skill level
She also said safety and comfort matter, and she would rather join a small group first than meet one stranger one on one
After hearing the app concept she said a feature to join open groups and see how active they are would make her use it

# Manav
1st interview:
I talked to a student who likes attending random social events.
He said it is difficult to get into playing sports, because their friends often have schedule conflicts and sometimes do not want to commit to an activity.
They say because of this, they oftentimes just opt not to play, and do other activities with more people instead of pursuing what they may have wanted to explore.
A solution they try to do to resolve this is try to schedule dates far in advance to play, but they say this is inconvenient because he wants to play sooner rather than later.
After speaking about our app idea, they thought it was a decent solution, but he would feel uncomfortable playing with strangers.
He suggested emphasizing user profiles to make it easier to play with new people and potentially make new friends.

2nd interview:
I talked to a student who likes to play soccer and other sports.
He said while he normally doesn't have an issue finding friends to play sports with, that on some days when friends are out due to holidays or in general, that he feels very bored and wishes that he could join quick matches.
I asked what were some solutions he had for this matter. He said that he joins social media platforms (i.e. Discord, Insta groups, etc) and clubs, and tries to arrange games that way.
They told me this solution was not consistently effective.
After introducing our app idea, he said it would be something he would be willing to try, but he voiced concerns about the amount of people on the app. They suggested maybe trying some way to make an integration with another social media app.

1st interview:
I asked him to tell me about a time he had to find people to do an activity with.
He said that in his management class there were a lot of people who weren’t being proactive. There was an important assignment with deadlines to be met but no one wanted to take initiative to actually schedule a time or organize the work.
I asked him what was hard about it and he said it was getting people to actually agree to a time. Messages would go unanswered and nothing moved unless someone pushed it.
I then asked why it was hard and whether there was a group leader to decide on a mutual time.
He said since it was a group task, everyone waited for someone else to take the lead. People didn’t put in much effort even though they cared about the grade.
I asked how they went about solving the issue.
He said he would give a few specific time options and ask people to pick one. He also messaged people individually sometimes because they responded faster than in group chats.
I then asked if he felt that solution was optimal or good enough.
He said it worked but usually meant he ended up doing most of the coordinating. It fixed the problem short term but didn’t make everyone equally involved.

2nd interview:
I talked to another student in the same Econ class about their experience finding time to meet for group assignments.
He said he encountered the same issue where no one took initiative to discuss or plan a time to meet until it was near the assignment deadline. When he asked about it, people just assumed someone else would take the liberty to organize everything.
I asked what he thought was hard about finding a time to discuss the assignment.
He said everyone has different schedules and priorities, and agreeing on a mutual time with around 8 people was tedious and annoying. Even if half the group agreed, it was messy to track who was coming and how to delegate tasks.
I then asked why it was so hard.
He said it was bothersome for some students to keep discussing scheduling when they could be doing something else. People usually left it to a group leader, but when there wasn’t one, nothing happened.
I asked how they solved the issue.
He said they split into smaller mini-groups and assigned tasks without meeting.
He explained that this created confusion because some groups didn’t update others, and key information didn’t get shared.
I asked if he felt that was the best or most optimal solution.
He said definitely not. It created more frustration and wasted time asking around for updates. He felt they could have finished faster with just a few proper meetings.

# Kelvin
1st interview:
I talked to a president of a ethnic culture club at UC Davis.
I asked him to tell me about the last time he tried to plan something with his friends like a hangout.
He said he recently planned a dinner night where they would study and eat together at a friend’s place.
I asked him what was hard about planning it.
He said prepping the food and managing time was the hardest part.
I then asked why it was hard.
He explained that he had class on the same day, so he had to plan bussing back home, buying ingredients, and figuring out how to cook everything before coming over. Managing all of that within a limited time window made it stressful.
I asked how he solved the issue.
He said he bought the ingredients beforehand but decided to cook at his friend’s place instead. That way he didn’t have to carry cooked food and it saved time.
I then asked why that solution was not good enough or if it was optimal.
He said it was good enough for the situation, but ideally he would have meal-prepped the food the night before. However, he mentioned there are trade-offs to that too, like freshness and extra preparation time the day before.
I asked him if having his friends cook food too would have helped.
He said that yes it would have helped, but it was too hard to coordinate with his friends what ingredients and food they needed to bring to have a successful dinner with everything involved.

2nd interview:
I talked to an avid gymbro while we were at the gym.
I asked him to tell me about another time he tried to plan something with his friends.
He said he recently tried to plan a gym time with his friend.
I asked him what was hard about planning it.
He said everyone was too busy.
I then asked why it was hard.
He explained that his friends were busy applying for jobs or doing homework, so their schedules didn’t line up.
I asked how he solved the issue.
He said he would ask random people at the gym if they wanted to work out together or spot him.
I then asked why that solution was not good enough.
He said people aren’t always willing to do it, so it’s inconsistent and not reliable.
