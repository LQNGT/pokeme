1st interview: 
I talked to a member of the badminton club 
I asked him if he ever played badminton outside of the club and he said no
When I asked why he said it's because he doesn't have anyone to play with
i then asked him what's hard about finding people to play with outside of the club and he said that most people that play at the ARC already have their own group so it's hard to just go and join a court
I then asked him about a solution that could solve this issue but he couldn't think of anything
I pitched our app idea to him and he said that it would definitely solve his issue however he mentionned an issue with the app. Basically once people find their sports buddy/group on the app they would stop using it.

2nd interview:
I talked to a student who plays volleyball
She told me that she only plays back home with her friends because she does not have a friend group here in Davis thhat can play volleyball
She explained to me that Volleyball is one of those sports where you can just go to a court and join the game
I asked her why she doesn't just do that and she said because sometimes the teams are full and she feels nervous joining random people's games
I asked her what would solve her issue and she said the intramural programs at the ARC sounds interesting
The issue with intramural is that it's a quarter long tournamnet so it's a lot of commitment
I then told her about our app idea and she pointed out that we should implement a way to join groups of people rather then just one to one matchings.
