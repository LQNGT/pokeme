“PokeMe”—A college-campus social app where you are paired with a random, different student everyday. You can optionally add some filters (like major). If you disconnect from a connection, you still have to wait until the day is over for the next connection. You can do things like chat, send photos (cooldown), send pokes, etc. Interactions in the app can have an earned digital currency (like pokes cost 50 social points). There can be other social aspects in the app (image leaderboard, side quests, etc).
